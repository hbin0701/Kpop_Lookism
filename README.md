# ðŸ˜Ž Kpop_Lookism: ðŸ˜Ž
##### Twitter &amp; Instagram Data Analysis to find artifacts from **K-Pop's promotion of Lookism.**
------
This was done as a part of project for KAIST **HSS407 Computational Social Science.**
This repo mainly consists of three .ipynb files.
1. Tweeter ``Visual`` Analysis
... Which is the part where posts (and contained images) from idols' official pages were analyzed.

2. Tweeter ``Comment`` Analysis
... Which is the part where comments from users retweets **to** idols' official pages were analyzed.

3. ``Instagram`` Analysis
... Where the comments from each idol's instagram posts were analyzed.

Note: I'm also planning to uploadd my paper soon, just in case you're interested! ðŸ˜ƒ
